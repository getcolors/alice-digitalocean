# Shared compute migration

Installed `getcolors/alice` revision `31d4e3a71bd7654b27dca9c38d9b2db05e0e2669`. Root launchers match the
installed skill payloads from a verified Skills CLI installation.
This remains a manual installation, with no invented lockfile.

Compute now uses colors-compute shared and node state under
`<profile>/compute/`. Application stages retain their existing ownership.
This refresh does not transfer resource ownership or apply infrastructure.
No live state, private credentials, or private key contents were read.

Before create, preserve the old state, inventory the existing resources and SSH
key ownership, and review explicit source/destination resource mappings and a
plan with no unintended replacement. Recognized legacy remote state causes the
library to refuse the operation. Do not discard old state or bypass that check.
The committed deployment profile and destroy protection are preserved.

Validation: the published green launchers built the desired state
in temporary directories with a sanitized environment. Compute documents were
present and rendered backend configuration contained no credentials. Offline
builds do not establish live authentication, migrated state, or application health.

Configuration changes:

- Selected the existing workspace R2 backend and enabled compute-require-existing-state. The former local state is retained and must be migrated before create.

The existing-state guard prevents fresh creation in an empty R2 backend.
Keep it enabled after transfer; it is not a migration executor.

Repeated deletion after validated compute retirement resumes only local cleanup,
without SSH keys or remote application stages. Failed ownership inspection
still blocks deletion. The refreshed published launcher passed an additional
offline build of this unchanged configuration in a temporary directory.
